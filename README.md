## Description
This Project involved creating an E-Commerce Backend with Express.js, MySQL and Sequelize to query and interact with a database.

A Database is created via the MySQL Shell and is then synced to and seeded with Sequelize.

Three tables are created;
- Categories
- Products
- Tags

It utilises CRUD, the four basic operations of persistant storage, to add, view, update and delete tables and data on the database.

Insomnia is used to perform the various requests to the Express.js server as it provides an easy to use interface for interacting with HTTP-based API's.
